CHOWN(1)                          User Commands                          CHOWN(1)

NAME
       chown - change file owner and group

SYNOPSIS
       chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...
       chown [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of chown.  chown changes the
       user and/or group ownership of each given file.  If only an owner (a  user
       name  or  numeric  user  ID) is given, that user is made the owner of each
       given file, and the files' group is not changed.  If the owner is followed
       by  a colon and a group name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces between
       them, the group ownership of the files is changed as well.  If a colon but
       no  group  name  follows the user name, that user is made the owner of the
       files and the group of the files is changed to that  user's  login  group.
       If the colon and group are given, but the owner is omitted, only the group
       of the files is changed; in this case, chown performs the same function as
       chgrp.   If only a colon is given, or if the entire operand is empty, nei‐
       ther the owner nor the group is changed.

OPTIONS
       Change the owner and/or group of each FILE to OWNER  and/or  GROUP.   With
       --reference, change the owner and group of each FILE to those of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --dereference
              affect  the  referent  of each symbolic link (this is the default),
              rather than the symbolic link itself

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect symbolic links instead of any referenced file  (useful  only
              on systems that can change the ownership of a symlink)

       --from=CURRENT_OWNER:CURRENT_GROUP
              change  the  owner  and/or  group  of each file only if its current
              owner and/or group match those specified here.  Either may be omit‐
              ted,  in  which case a match is not required for the omitted attri‐
              bute

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's owner and group rather than specifying OWNER:GROUP val‐
              ues

       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively

       The  following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R op‐
       tion is also specified.  If more than one is specified, only the final one
       takes effect.

       -H     if  a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, tra‐
              verse it

       -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Owner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged if missing, but changed
       to  login group if implied by a ':' following a symbolic OWNER.  OWNER and
       GROUP may be numeric as well as symbolic.

EXAMPLES
       chown root /u
              Change the owner of /u to "root".

       chown root:staff /u
              Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".

       chown -hR root /u
              Change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".
